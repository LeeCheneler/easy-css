easy-css is a simple, layout only ITCSS and BEMIT SASS framework. It does not extend beyond the object layer in ITCSS and so has no visual styling.

## Getting Started

easy-css is designed to be extended, not consumed. If you just compiled and used it in your site you will find that you hit specificity issues when placing your own CSS beneath it.

### Minimum App SCSS Directory Structure
```
-scss
|__
```

## Inspiration
Great inspiration was taken from the [nebula-css](https://github.com/rbrtsmith/nebula-css) framework written by a great CSS author Robert Smith. He's been a great mentor throughout its development.
