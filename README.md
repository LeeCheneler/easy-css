# easy-css
A simple ITCSS framework designed to be the initial building blocks for a website. This was mainly written as a learning exercise, it is by no means original. But it is hopefully good enough for production sites to be built on top of it!

Check the demo out [here](https://leecheneler.github.io/easy-css/demo/)!

Great inspiration was taken from the nebula-css framework written by a great CSS author Robert Smith. Check it out at [here](http://rbrtsmith.com/nebula-css/).
